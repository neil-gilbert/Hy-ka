# Vision

Engineering organisations are adopting AI models rapidly.

However, there is no objective way to answer:

- Which model is best for our workflows?
- Is a new model upgrade actually better?
- Are we getting value for cost?

This platform solves that.

# What this product is

A model evaluation platform for engineering workflows.

It provides:

- Experiment management
- Reproducible runs
- Objective scoring
- Dashboard comparison

---

# What this product is NOT

Not a PR bot.

Not an autonomous agent.

Not a Copilot replacement.

---

# Core Principle

Separation of:

Evaluation

and

Execution

This system observes and measures.

It does not modify source code.
